			<p>Network Neutrality is the guiding principle of the open internet, and is fundamental to ensure that the internet remains a platform for the enjoyment of human rights and innovation. Net neutrality means that all traffic on the internet is treated on an equal basis, no matter the origin, type of content or means. </p>

			<p>The EU Commission has promised to safeguard the internet's foundational principle in a Regulation, but the text fails to deliver net neutrality. Unless you take action to help the European Parliament fix the text, the internet will soon look more like cable TV, where your operator has total control over what you can access online, even charging you extra for certain services. </p>

			<p>We need your help to tell Parliamentarians to protect the open and neutral internet - tell them to protect network neutrality!</p>

			<h3>What is going on in the EU?</h3>

			<p>The Commissioner for the Digital Agenda Neelie Kroes promised to safeguard network neutrality. However, in the past few years her position has changed significantly in the opposite direction. Her proposal for a Regulation for a Telecom Single Market confirms this. While we welcome the intention to enshrine net neutrality into law across the EU, the proposal fails to deliver promise of Net Net Neutrality as it contains several problematic loopholes. However, the text itself is not far off the mark. With the right improvements, the European Union could have binding net neutrality legislation.	The proposal is now in hands of the Parliament and will be reviewed by several committees, with the Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) committee as the lead in charge of this dossier. The modifications introduced in some committees have regrettably worsened the problems in the Commission proposal. Furthermore, the legislation is on a very strict timeline, as the Parliament hopes to conclude negotiations before elections in May 2014, which has made the window for consultation very small (see below our timeline for the proposal). To find out more, read our Opinion on the proposed Regulation (<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/access.3cdn.net/eb2b4943583975dddc_wem6ivd90.pdf">here</a>) and our proposed amendments on how to improve the text (<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/access.3cdn.net/7a87df88dc742379d9_7tm6iiq24.pdf">here</a>). Stay tuned to find out how you can help achieve network neutrality in Europe!</p>
				
			<h3>Arguments</h3>
			<h4>Specialised Services</h4>
			<p>Internet companies, quite reasonably, claim the right to provide specialised network services – such as high definition video at guaranteed speeds for precise industrial applications. As long as these services are run separately from the Internet and do not interfere with internet quality, this is clearly not a problem.</p>
			<p>Currently, the proposed Regulation does not give a clear definition of specialised services. It would allow for the possibility of a “specialised service” to be interpreted as meaning any kind of online service. This would lead to the creation of a two-tiered internet, where certain services would be prioritised and others would be pushed into the slow lane. As a consequence, this would restrict the freedom of communication and the possibilities and incentives for innovation. (Article 2.15)</p>
			<p><b>Example:</b> Many mobile operators already offer unmetered access to Facebook, with everything else being subject to a payment based on the volume of downloaded data. If the definition of a “specialised service” allows this kind of offer, it will restrict the possible market available to potential competitors, restricting choice and innovation in the long run.</p>
			<p><b>What we need</b> is a clarification to ensure that the “service” in question is not functionally identical to an online service and that it is run on a network that is entirely separate from the public internet. The Body of European Regulators (BEREC) definition states that such services have to be separate from the public best effort internet and shall be only provided within the European electronic communications provider’s network. Not alone is the Commission’s proposal less clear than this definition, but it adds qualifiers like “substantially”, “general” and “widely”, which are not defined and can clearly only generate legal uncertainty.</p>
			<h4>The “freedom” of end-users</h4>
			<p>The text proposed by the European Commission would give users the “freedom” to choose discriminatory services. This “freedom” will ultimately be negative for internet users and negative for the broader online innovative environment (Article 23).</p>
			<p><b>Example:</b> It has been estimated that British consumers alone pay approximately 5 billion pounds a year too much, due to their “freedom” to choose between numerous confusing service options.</p>
			<p><b>What we need</b> is to replace “shall be free” with “have the right” and to ensure that the text does not allow discriminatory services to be offered by internet access providers.</p>

			<h4>“Prevent or impede serious crime”</h4>
			<p>There is no definition of “serious crime”. It is also unclear what “measures to prevent” would entail. However, it is clear from the context that to “prevent or impede serious crime” means ad hoc interference with online communications by internet companies, without a legal basis or a court order. (Article 23.5).</p>
			<p><b>Example:</b> In the UK, for example, voluntary measures are already being carried out by ISPs to prevent individuals leading to lawless blocking of a range of legal online services. In 2012, this led to the accidental blocking of the website of the French civil rights group, La Quadrature du Net.</p>
			<p><b>What we need</b> is a deletion of the dangerous exception for arbitrary interferences in communications traffic flows of reasonable traffic management, as this provision is in obvious violation of Article 52 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

			<h3>famous critics</h3>
			<p>The critic on the proposed regulation came from many directions. First from the comission itself, even before the draft was publicly announced <a href="http://edri.org/NN-negativeopinions/">one part of the commission criticed the other</a> because this proposal is dangerous for net neutrality.</p>
			<p>The seond most critic is the <a href="http://berec.europa.eu/eng/document_register/subject_matter/berec/opinions/?doc=2922">Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communication</a> (BEREC). This independend expert group of national regulators helped the objective discussion about net neutrality a lot and came up with many <a href="http://berec.europa.eu/eng/document_register/subject_matter/berec/regulatory_best_practices/guidelines/1101-berec-guidelines-for-quality-of-service-in-the-scope-of-net-neutrality">good definitionst</a> (e.g. for specialised services) and statistical data that showed that <a href="https://unsernetz.at/links/berec-eu-violations/">half of europs population is already affected by net neutrality violations in the mobile sector</a>. Also the <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_EDPS-13-10_en.htm">European Data Protection Supervisor</a> warns for loopholes in the net neutrality provisions and is highlighting the danger for the protection of our communication data in the new regime. </p>
			<p>Civil Society has been watching this EU regulation very closely. You can find a great overview about the Dossier at <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/policy/Network-Discrimination-Europe">Access Now</a>, <a href="http://edri.org/european-parliament-will-rule-on-net-neutrality/">European Digital Rights</a> and <a href="http://www.laquadrature.net/en/Net_neutrality">La Quadratur du Net</a>. </p>
